pid simulator

1 build a pid block from scratch
2 build a simulation enviroment for the block something that simulates different heating enviroments, maybe flow enviroments and so on.
3 some more advanced stuff like making it posible to do a cascade control loop or maybe a feedforward.
4 maybe some filtering options for jittery inputs, and simulation of process values that dont behaive nicely on their own
